3. open any browser and navigate to [localhost]

## Team P1-6's Workflow:
**Rules:**

- Features assigned to different members of the team MUST have their own branch per feature under dev branch.

- This code MUST only be pushed to the respective feature branches before merging to the master branch.

**Feature Branch Management:**
1. one branch per feature
    - `<feature_name>` for WebPortal features
    - `<management_feature_name>` for project or repo management features 

2. Developers should create feature branch from master branch
3. Push code to branch ONLY when it is completed 

**Development Branch Management:**
1. The master branch always reflects the production-ready state
2. Completed and tested features branches should be merged into dev branch
3. This code is again tested after merging with dev branch, if errors, proceed to merge with  the master branch

**Main Branch Management:**
1. only dev branch can be merged to the main branch

**Release Branch Management**
1. Developers can create release branch `rel_<version_num>`
2. All releases also branch off dev but merge back into BOTH dev and master

**Hotfix Branch Management**
1. Developers can create the hotfix branch `hotfix_<minor_version_num>`
2. All hotfixes branch off master and merge back into both dev and master
